The mission statement of the Target Storybook is to provide short stories that, in the best Target tradition, enhance or extend what we saw on TV. Naturally, with fifteen stories in total (one for each of the first twelve Doctors, plus the War Doctor, and two from the Thirteenth Doctor’s era) the quality varies, as does the approach to that mandate. While some of the entries genuinely feel like asides to an existing story, others are more awkwardly placed during, but separate from, their TV starting point. Some even seem completely standalone with only the haziest throwaway reference to establish a sense of being set between this serial and that one. Though all are accompanied by a brilliant new black and white drawing from Mike Collins, in the tradition of some of the earliest books.

The very fact that Patel includes no spoilers for the TV episode and leaves the Thijarians’ intentions unclear even at the end of his prequel, creates a powerful sense of this being simply the first chapter of a proper, full, novelization. And of Patel having a complete Doctor Who and the Demons of the Punjab taking up space at the back of his mind. Based on the evidence of Letters from the Front, I certainly hope he gets the chance to write it one day.
